# Case Management System

## Overview
The Case Management System is a console-based application designed to help prosecutors manage case information and court dates more efficiently. This project was developed to transition from a manual, paper-based system to a digital solution. It allows users to upload cases, manage postponement dates, view daily court cases, search through cases, and track older and completed cases.

## Features
- **Case Upload**: Add new cases to the system along with their details.
- **Manage Postponement Dates**: Update and manage the postponement dates for each case.
- **Daily Court Cases View**: View cases that are scheduled for court on a specific day.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for cases using specific search terms to quickly find relevant information.
- **View Older Cases**: View cases that are older than six months.
- **Completed Cases**: Indicate and view which cases have already been completed.

## Setup Instructions
To set up and run the Case Management System locally, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Visual Studio Community 2019 installed on your machine.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.
3. **Open Project**: Open the project files in Visual Studio Community 2019.
4. **Build and Run**: Build the project and run it from Visual Studio. The console application will start, and you will be prompted with a menu of options.

## Usage Instructions
Upon running the application, you will interact with the console through a series of prompts. The main menu offers several options:

- **Add New Case**: Follow the prompts to enter case details and add a new case to the system.
